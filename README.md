EyeLinkIO
=========

A lightweight library to import SR Research EDF files into Python.

**This Software is currenly pre-alpha, meaning it is currently being developed**: Changes to the API (function names, etc.), or even the name of this package, may occur without warning. This library has been tested with MacOS and Linux, but not Windows.

About the Eyelink Data Format
=============================

The EyeLink Data Format (EDF; not to be confused with the [European Data Format](<https://www.edfplus.info>)) is used for storing eyetracking data from EyeLink eyetrackers. It was put forward by the company [SR Research](<https://www.sr-research.com>). SR Research EDF files store data in a binary format, and reading these files currently requires the `eyelink-edfapi` C library that is included in the EyeLink Software Development Kit.

Dependencies
============

Strictly speaking, EyeLinkIO only requires Numpy, and that the user has the [EyeLink Software Development Kit](<https://www.sr-research.com/support/forum-3.html>) installed on their machine (One must create a login on the forum to access the download). For converting data to pandas `DataFrames` or MNE-Python `Raw` instances, you must have those respective packages installed.

Example Usage
=============

```python

from eyelinkio import read_edf
eyelinkio.utils import _get_test_fnames  # for demonstration purposes only

fname = _get_test_fnames()[0]  # Replace this function with the path to your EDF file
edf_file = read_edf(fname)
print(edf_file)
```

```
<EDF | test_raw.edf> 
  Version: EYELINK II 1 
  Eye: LEFT_EYE 
  Pupil unit: PUPIL_AREA 
  Sampling frequency: 1000.0 Hz 
  Calibrations: 1 
  Length: 66.827 seconds 
```

```
# Convert to a pandas DataFrame or an MNE Raw instance
dfs = edf_file.to_data_frame()
raw, calibration = edf_file.to_mne()
```

Acknowledgements
================

This package was originally adapted from the [pyeparse](<https://github.com/pyeparse/pyeparse>) package (created by several of the core developers of [MNE-Python](<https://mne.tools/dev/index.html>)). It copies much of the EDF (Eyelink Data Format) reading code.
